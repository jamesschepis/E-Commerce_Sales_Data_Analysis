### **Project Background**
This project focuses on analyzing sales data obtained on Kaggle from an e-commerce platform to uncover actionable insights. By exploring customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends, the analysis aims to provide key metrics and visualizations that inform strategic business decisions.

### **Executive Summary**
The analysis offers a comprehensive view of e-commerce performance, revealing trends in gross sales, product returns, customer spending, and regional contributions.  
Key highlights include:  
- Gross sales showed a decline of ~$6 million from April to June, with specific cities contributing significantly to this drop.  
- B2B customers tend to have a higher average order value (AOV) compared to B2C customers.  
- Certain products experience disproportionately high return rates, impacting net revenue.  

These findings highlight opportunities for optimizing product offerings, targeting high-value customer segments, and addressing areas with high return or refund rates.

### **Insights Deep-Dive**

#### **Sales Trends**
- **Monthly Gross Sales**: Bar charts reveal fluctuations in total revenue across months.  
- **Daily Gross Sales**: Line graphs track granular day-to-day sales trends.  
- **City-Based Performance**: The top 10 cities by revenue are highlighted, showing regional contributions over time.  

#### **Product Insights**
- **Product Sales Performance**: Identifies best-selling and underperforming products by category.  
- **Return Rates**: Analyzes refund, return, and cancellation rates by product category over months, providing insights into customer dissatisfaction.  

#### **Customer Metrics**
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Tracks monthly AOV to understand customer spending patterns.  
- **B2B vs B2C Comparison**: Breaks down AOV to compare the spending behaviors of B2B and B2C customers.

### **Recommendations**
1. **Focus on High-Value Cities**: Prioritize marketing and fulfillment efforts in cities with consistent sales growth.  
2. **Reduce Product Returns**: Investigate high-return products to improve descriptions, quality, or policies.  
3. **Target B2B Customers**: Leverage the higher AOV for B2B clients by offering exclusive discounts or loyalty programs.  
4. **Address Declining Sales**: Examine the significant revenue drop between April and June to identify root causes and rectify them.

### **Assumptions and Caveats**
1. **Data Quality**: The analysis assumes that the data is accurate and complete. Inconsistencies in data entry (e.g., city names) were corrected during preprocessing.  
2. **Timeframe Limitations**: The dataset spans only three months, which may not represent long-term trends.  
3. **External Factors**: No adjustments were made for external influences such as seasonality, promotions, or economic factors.  
4. **Net Revenue Calculations**: Refunds, returns, and cancellations were excluded from net revenue, but handling or restocking fees were not factored in.
